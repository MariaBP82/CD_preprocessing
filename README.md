# Improving community detection algorithms in directed graphs with fuzzy measures. An application to mobility networks
ABSTRACT
Social network analysis holds great importance in unraveling and understanding  intricate human connections and interactions. This paper focuses on a novel aggregation paradigm which combines social networks with fuzzy measures. In this work, we focus on exploring the potential of incorporating information from fuzzy measures, specifically through the utilization of the flow capacity measure, to improve and optimize various community detection algorithms. We present a detailed evaluation process to affirm the effectiveness of this methodology.  To achieve this, we  analyze a robust repository of databases, using several classical community detection techniques. A comprehensive comparison of these results with the new methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of the presented aggregation paradigm, showcasing its profound impact on enhancing modularity. We also present a case study in which, in addition to numerically demonstrating the improvement of results, there is evidence of real advancement, specifically in terms of train station connectivity, with the application of the new methodology.
