# Improving community detection algorithms in directed graphs with fuzzy measures. An application to mobility networks
# ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a novel methodology to enhance any community detection
algorithm for directed networks by introducing a flow-based fuzzy
measure, which improves both partition quality and the interpretability of
the algorithm. To do so, we focus on a novel aggregation paradigm which
combines social networks with fuzzy measures. We explore the potential of
incorporating information from fuzzy measures, specifically with a flow capacity
measure, to improve and optimize community detection algorithms.
We present a detailed evaluation process to demonstrate the effectiveness
of this methodology. To achieve this, we analyze a robust repository of
databases, using several classical community detection techniques. A comprehensive
comparison of classic results with the new methodology demonstrates
the effectiveness of the presented aggregation paradigm. We reach a
more conclusive understanding of the impact of our methodology through the
application of machine learning techniques. We also illustrate its effectiveness
through a case study. In addition to demonstrating numerical improvements
in results, we provide tangible evidence of real-world advancements. We observe
enhanced connectivity in mobility analysis resulting from the consideration
of the flow capacity measure. Therefore, the proposed methodology
enhances community detection performance in directed networks by incorporating
flow-based fuzzy measures. This is demonstrated through a case study 
that showcases improved partition quality compared to traditional algorithms,
along with theoretical insights into the fuzzy approach.
